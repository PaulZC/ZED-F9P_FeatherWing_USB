# ZED-F9P_FeatherWing
_USB

An **untested** GNSS FeatherWing incorporating the dual-band (L1 + L2) [u-blox ZED-F9P](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/zed-f9p-module)

This version provides access to the ZED-F9P's USB port. The [ZED-F9P_FeatherWing](https://github.com/PaulZC/ZED-F9P_FeatherWing) is a simpler version
with fewer components and a CR1220 back-up battery but without USB.

Based extensively on the [Adafruit Ultimate GPS FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3133) and the
[SparkFun GPS-RTK2 Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136)

The Eagle files are available in the [Eagle folder](https://github.com/PaulZC/ZED-F9P_FeatherWing_USB/tree/master/Eagle)

The schematic is available [here](https://github.com/PaulZC/ZED-F9P_FeatherWing_USB/blob/master/img/Schematic.PNG)

The BOM is available [here](https://github.com/PaulZC/ZED-F9P_FeatherWing_USB/blob/master/BOM.pdf)

PCB thickness should be 0.8mm: see the microstrip calculations on the [SparkFun schematic](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/a/0/0/a/Qwiic_GPS-RTK2_-_ublox_ZED-F9P.pdf)
